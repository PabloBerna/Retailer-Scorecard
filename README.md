# Retailer-Scorecard
Project of my Bachelor's Thesis in Business Admistration

- A dynamic scorecard using Power BI, integrating various business metrics to track and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) across the organization.
- Interactive dashboards tailored to different departments, enabling stakeholders to explore real-time data on customer behavior, sales trends, and marketing effectiveness.

Note: The scorecard and the data are in spanish, due to the final stakeholders wanted in this way.
